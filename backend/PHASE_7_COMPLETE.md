## Phase Summary

### Phase 7.1: Feasible Triples Generation
- **Purpose**: Generate all valid (vehicle, partner, start_day) combinations
- **Constraints**: Make eligibility, availability, operational capacity
- **Output**: ~60K triples for LA

### Phase 7.2: Core OR-Tools Solver
- **Purpose**: Fundamental optimization with hard constraints
- **Constraints**: VIN uniqueness, daily capacity limits
- **Technology**: Google OR-Tools CP-SAT solver

### Phase 7.3: Cooldown Constraint Filter
- **Purpose**: Enforce minimum time between loans
- **Implementation**: Pre-filter before solver (HARD constraint)
- **Default**: 30 days between same partner-model loans

### Phase 7.4s: Soft Tier Caps
- **Purpose**: Manage annual loan limits per partner-make
- **Implementation**: Penalty-based (Î»_cap = 800)
- **Innovation**: Delta overage - only penalize NEW violations

### Phase 7.5: Distribution Fairness
- **Purpose**: Discourage over-concentration to same partners
- **Implementation**: Mode B stepped penalties (Î»_fair = 200 + 400)
- **Result**: 48 partners vs 7 without fairness

### Phase 7.6: Quarterly Budget Constraints
- **Purpose**: Respect office Ã— fleet Ã— quarter budgets
- **Implementation**: Soft penalties (3 points/dollar) or hard limits
- **Data Source**: Live `budgets` table

## Unified Objective Function

```
Maximize:
    Î£(assignment_scores)
    - Î»_cap Ã— Î£(tier_cap_overages)           [7.4s]
    - Î»_fair Ã— Î£(fairness_penalties)         [7.5]
    - points_per_dollar Ã— Î£(budget_overages) [7.6]
```

## Policy Recommendations

### Standard Operations
```python
# Balanced configuration
lambda_cap = 800       # Tier caps
lambda_fair = 200      # Base fairness
fair_step_up = 400     # Mode B step
points_per_dollar = 3  # Budget penalty
enforce_budget_hard = False
```

### Tight Budget Period
```python
# Conservative configuration
lambda_cap = 1200      # Stricter caps
lambda_fair = 400      # More distribution
fair_step_up = 600     # Stronger step
points_per_dollar = 5  # Higher budget penalty
enforce_budget_hard = True  # Optional
```

### High Demand Period
```python
# Permissive configuration
lambda_cap = 400       # Relaxed caps
lambda_fair = 100      # Allow concentration
fair_step_up = 0       # Mode A only
points_per_dollar = 1  # Minimal budget penalty
enforce_budget_hard = False
```

## Validation & Testing
